        <p id="P1-1">An interstellar object is an astronomical object (an asteroid, comet or possibly planet, but not a star or substar) that is located in interstellar space and is not gravitationally bound to a star. The term can also be applied to objects that are on an interstellar trajectory but are temporarily passing close to a star, such as certain asteroids and comets (including exocomets).</p>

        <p id="P1"> Due to present observational difficulties, an interstellar object can usually only be detected if it passes through the Solar System, where it can be distinguished by its strongly hyperbolic trajectory, indicating that it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun. In contrast, gravitationally bound objects follow elliptic orbits around the Sun, like most asteroids, comets, and objects in the Oort cloud.</p>

Shaw served as an officer in the United States Army during World War II. He served as secretary to the General Staff and later served in Europe. He was decorated by three nations: the United States with the Legion of Merit and Bronze Star, by France with the Croix de Guerre and named Chevalier de l'Ordre du Merite, and by Belgium named Chevalier of the Order of the Crown of Belgium. Shaw was honorably discharged from the United States Army as a major in 1946.</p>
        <p id="p2">The 2018 World Women's Snooker Championship was a professional women's snooker tournament that took place at the Dolmen Hotel, St. Paul's Bay, in Malta from 14 to 17 March 2018. Defending champion Ng On-yee won the event with a 5–0 win against Maria Catalano in the final. Ng On-yee won the title without losing a single frame over all six of her matches and as champion, qualified to enter the 2018 World Snooker Championship.

This was the first time that the snooker world championship for women was organised under the banner of the World Snooker Federation (WSF). The WSF was formed in October 2017, supported by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association and the European Billiards and Snooker Association.[2] The event saw a slightly increased prize fund, with the winner receiving €6,000.</p>
